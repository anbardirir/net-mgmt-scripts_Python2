Network Management Scripts
Disclaimer
I am network engineer by trade thats trying to learn coding.
In the process of learning I have created some scripts to test my knowledge in a lab environment.
All of these scripts should not be considered production ready should you want to test them I would try them in a lab and not on your production network.
Best coding practices are probably out the window as it pertains to my scripts.
While I am enjoying the process of learning it does not mean that I am any good at this.
Happy coding.
