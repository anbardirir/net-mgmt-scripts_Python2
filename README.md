# Network Automation Scripts
# Disclaimer
I am network systems engineer by trade thats trying to make use of a programming language to make useful scripts.
Should you want to test them, I would recommend trying them in a lab environment.
Best coding practices are probably out the window as it pertains to my scripts.
While I am enjoying this process I am still new to this.
