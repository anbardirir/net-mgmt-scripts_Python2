Network Management Scripts
Disclaimer
I am network engineer by trade thats trying to learn coding.
In the process of learning I have created some scripts to test my knowledge.
These scripts should not be considered production ready.  Should you want to test them, I would recommend trying them in a lab environment and not on your production network.
Best coding practices are probably out the window as it pertains to my scripts.
While I am enjoying this process it does not mean that I am any good at this.
Happy coding.
